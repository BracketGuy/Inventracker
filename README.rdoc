== README

This application is for keeping track of computers and users. It uses a lot of old school rails routes (not resource routing),
form tags (not form_for stuff), and is not RESTful at all, because I wanted to be very explicit about how stuff works an not
just lean on best practices because I'm crazy apparently. Just kidding, I just wanted to write an app this way for some reason.
